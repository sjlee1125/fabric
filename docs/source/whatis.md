# Introduction

In general terms, a blockchain is an immutable transaction ledger, maintained
within a distributed network of _peer nodes_. These nodes each maintain a copy
of the ledger by applying transactions that have been validated by a _consensus
protocol_, grouped into blocks that include a hash that bind each block to the
preceding block.

일반적으로 블록체인은 peer 노드로 이루어진 분산화된 네트워크안에서 유지되는 불변의 거래장부입니다.
트랜잭션은 합의 프로토콜 (전 블록의 hash를 현 블록에 기록해 블록을 연결) 에 따라 검증이 되고 장부에 기록이 됩니다. 각각의 노드들은 장부의 복사본을 유지합니다.

The first and most widely recognized application of blockchain is the
[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) cryptocurrency, though others
have followed in its footsteps. Ethereum, an alternative cryptocurrency, took a
different approach, integrating many of the same characteristics as Bitcoin but
adding _smart contracts_ to create a platform for distributed applications.
Bitcoin and Ethereum fall into a class of blockchain that we would classify as
_public permissionless_ blockchain technology. Basically, these are public
networks, open to anyone, where participants interact anonymously.

블록체인 중 가장 첫번째로 알려진건 가상화폐 비트코인입니다. 다른 가상화폐들도 비트코인을 따라갑니다.
이더리움은 비트코인의 많은 특징을 가져감과 동시에 분산화된 어플리케이션을 만들기 위한 스마트컨트랙트를 추가하였습니다.
비트코인과 이더리움은 public permissionless 블록체인이라고 분류합니다. public 블록체인은 누구에게나 열려있고
참여자들은 익명으로 상호작용합니다.

As the popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and a few other derivative technologies
grew, interest in applying the underlying technology of the blockchain,
distributed ledger and distributed application platform to more innovative
_enterprise_ use cases also grew. However, many enterprise use cases require
performance characteristics that the permissionless blockchain technologies are
unable (presently) to deliver. In addition, in many use cases, the identity of
the participants is a hard requirement, such as in the case of financial
transactions where Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
regulations must be followed.

블록체인과 이더리움이 유명해지고 몇가지 파생된 블록체인 기술이 발전하면서 블록체인 기술을 적용하는 관심 및
분산화 장부, 어플리케이션 플랫폼을 사업에 적용하는 케이스들도 같이 증가했습니다. 그러나 많은 사업화 모델이 
permissionless 블록체인이 맞지 않는다는 점을 내포하였습니다. 게다가 많은 유스 케이스 예를 들면 Know-Your-Customer (KYC) 와 Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
와같은 규제에서 참여자들의 신원은 필수 요소였습니다.

For enterprise use, we need to consider the following requirements:
산업에서 사용이 되려면 다름과 같은 필수요소가 팔요합니다:

- Participants must be identified/identifiable
- Networks need to be _permissioned_
- High transaction throughput performance
- Low latency of transaction confirmation
- Privacy and confidentiality of transactions and data pertaining to business
  transactions

- 참여자의 신분은 반드시 식별가능해야한다.
- 네트워크는 승인을 받아야한다.
- 대량 트랜잭션 처리 성능
- 빠른 트랜잭션 컨펌
- 트랜잭션의 프라이버시와 기밀유지 및 비스니스 트랜잭션에 대한 데이터 유지
 
While many early blockchain platforms are currently being _adapted_ for
enterprise use, Hyperledger Fabric has been _designed_ for enterprise use from
the outset. The following sections describe how Hyperledger Fabric (Fabric)
differentiates itself from other blockchain platforms and describes some of the
motivation for its architectural decisions.

많은 블록체인 플랫폼이 현재 기업에서 적용되는 한편 Hyperledger Fabric은 처음부터 기업형으로 디자인 되었습니다.
앞으로 나올 섹션들은 Hyperledger Fabric (Fabric)이 얼마나 다른 블록체인 플랫폼과 차별화되어있는지 설명하고
구조적 결정(디자인 결정)에 동기를 부여합니다. 

## Hyperledger Fabric

Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed
ledger technology (DLT) platform, designed for use in enterprise contexts,
that delivers some key differentiating capabilities over other popular
distributed ledger or blockchain platforms.

Hyperledger Fabric은 open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform
으로 기업을 대상으로 디자인 되었습니다. - 다른 유명한 분산화 장부나 블록체인 플랫폼으로부터 차별화된 포인트를 전달합니다.

One key point of differentiation is that Hyperledger was established under the
Linux Foundation, which itself has a long and very successful history of
nurturing open source projects under **open governance** that grow strong
sustaining communities and thriving ecosystems. Hyperledger is governed by a
diverse technical steering committee, and the Hyperledger Fabric project by a
diverse set of maintainers from multiple organizations. It has a development
community that has grown to over 35 organizations and nearly 200 developers
since its earliest commits.

Hyperledger의 첫번째 차별화 포인트는 리눅스 재단 아래 설립되었다는것이다.
리눅스 재단은 커뮤니티와 에코시스템을 탄탄히하는 open governance 아래 오픈소스 개발을 자체적으로 아주 오래했고 매우 성공적으로 이끌어낸 역사를 가지고 있다.
Hyperledger는 다양한 기술 관련 위원회에 의해 관리되며 Hyperledger Fabric 프로젝트는 다수의 기관에 있는
다양한 maintainer의 모임에 의해 유지된다. 최근 커밋까지 Hyperledger는 35개기관과 200명 가까이의 개발자를 가진
개발 커뮤니티를 가지고 있다.

Fabric has a highly **modular** and **configurable** architecture, enabling
innovation, versatility and optimization for a broad range of industry use cases
including banking, finance, insurance, healthcare, human resources, supply
chain and even digital music delivery.

Fabric은 modular하고 configurable한 구조를 가지고 있으며, banking, finance, insurance, healthcare, human resources, supply
chain 및 digital music delivery 등 넓은 범위의 industry use cases에서 innovation, versatility 와 optimization을 가능하게 한다. 

Fabric is the first distributed ledger platform to support **smart contracts
authored in general-purpose programming languages** such as Java, Go and
Node.js, rather than constrained domain-specific languages (DSL). This means
that most enterprises already have the skill set needed to develop smart
contracts, and no additional training to learn a new language or DSL is needed.

Fabric은 domain-specific languages (DSL) 와 같은 제한적인 언어 대신 Java, Go 및 Node.js와 같은 
general-purpose programming languages로 작성되는 스마트컨트랙트를 지원하는 첫번째 분산화 장부 플랫폼입니다.

The Fabric platform is also **permissioned**, meaning that, unlike with a public
permissionless network, the participants are known to each other, rather than
anonymous and therefore fully untrusted. This means that while the participants
may not _fully_ trust one another (they may, for example, be competitors in the
same industry), a network can be operated under a governance model that is built
off of what trust _does_ exist between participants, such as a legal agreement
or framework for handling disputes.

Fabric platform은 permissioned입니다. 이것은 익명이고 그러므로 완전히 untrusted한 public permissionless network와 
다르게 참여자들은 서로를 알고 있습니다. 참여자가 완전히 다른 참여자에 대한 신뢰가 없어도(ex-참여자가 경쟁자일때) 네트워크가 참여자간의 신뢰가 존재하는 것을
기반으로하는governance model아래 운영됩니다.

One of the most important of the platform's differentiators is its support for
**pluggable consensus protocols** that enable the platform to be more
effectively customized to fit particular use cases and trust models. For
instance, when deployed within a single enterprise, or operated by a trusted
authority, fully byzantine fault tolerant consensus might be considered
unnecessary and an excessive drag on performance and throughput. In situations
such as that, a
[crash fault-tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance) (CFT)
consensus protocol might be more than adequate whereas, in a multi-party,
decentralized use case, a more traditional
[byzantine fault tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance)
(BFT) consensus protocol might be required.

Fabric can leverage consensus protocols that **do not require a native
cryptocurrency** to incent costly mining or to fuel smart contract execution.
Avoidance of a cryptocurrency reduces some significant risk/attack vectors,
and absence of cryptographic mining operations means that the platform can be
deployed with roughly the same operational cost as any other distributed system.

The combination of these differentiating design features makes Fabric one of
the **better performing platforms** available today both in terms of transaction
processing and transaction confirmation latency, and it enables **privacy and confidentiality** of transactions and the smart contracts (what Fabric calls
"chaincode") that implement them.

Let's explore these differentiating features in more detail.

## Modularity

Hyperledger Fabric has been specifically architected to have a modular
architecture. Whether it is pluggable consensus, pluggable identity management
protocols such as LDAP or OpenID Connect, key management protocols or
cryptographic libraries, the platform has been designed at its core to be
configured to meet the diversity of enterprise use case requirements.

At a high level, Fabric is comprised of the following modular components:

- A pluggable _ordering service_ establishes consensus on the order of
transactions and then broadcasts blocks to peers.
- A pluggable _membership service provider_ is responsible for associating
entities in the network with cryptographic identities.
- An optional _peer-to-peer gossip service_ disseminates the blocks output by
ordering service to other peers.
- Smart contracts ("chaincode") run within a container environment (e.g. Docker)
for isolation. They can be written in standard programming languages but do not
have direct access to the ledger state.
- The ledger can be configured to support a variety of DBMSs.
- A pluggable endorsement and validation policy enforcement that can be
independently configured per application.

There is fair agreement in the industry that there is no "one blockchain to
rule them all". Hyperledger Fabric can be configured in multiple ways to
satisfy the diverse solution requirements for multiple industry use cases.

## Permissioned vs Permissionless Blockchains

In a permissionless blockchain, virtually anyone can participate, and every
participant is anonymous. In such a context, there can be no trust other than
that the state of the blockchain, prior to a certain depth, is immutable. In
order to mitigate this absence of trust, permissionless blockchains typically
employ a "mined" native cryptocurrency or transaction fees to provide economic
incentive to offset the extraordinary costs of participating in a form of
byzantine fault tolerant consensus based on "proof of work" (PoW).

**Permissioned** blockchains, on the other hand, operate a blockchain amongst
a set of known, identified and often vetted participants operating under a
governance model that yields a certain degree of trust. A permissioned
blockchain provides a way to secure the interactions among a group of entities
that have a common goal but which may not fully trust each other. By relying on
the identities of the participants, a permissioned blockchain can use more
traditional crash fault tolerant (CFT) or byzantine fault tolerant (BFT)
consensus protocols that do not require costly mining.

Additionally, in such a permissioned context, the risk of a participant
intentionally introducing malicious code through a smart contract is diminished.
First, the participants are known to one another and all actions, whether
submitting application transactions, modifying the configuration of the network
or deploying a smart contract are recorded on the blockchain following an
endorsement policy that was established for the network and relevant transaction
type. Rather than being completely anonymous, the guilty party can be easily
identified and the incident handled in accordance with the terms of the
governance model.

## Smart Contracts

A smart contract, or what Fabric calls "chaincode", functions as a trusted
distributed application that gains its security/trust from the blockchain and
the underlying consensus among the peers. It is the business logic of a
blockchain application.

There are three key points that apply to smart contracts, especially when
applied to a platform:

- many smart contracts run concurrently in the network,
- they may be deployed dynamically (in many cases by anyone), and
- application code should be treated as untrusted, potentially even
malicious.

Most existing smart-contract capable blockchain platforms follow an
**order-execute** architecture in which the consensus protocol:

- validates and orders transactions then propagates them to all peer nodes,
- each peer then executes the transactions sequentially.

The order-execute architecture can be found in virtually all existing blockchain
systems, ranging from public/permissionless platforms such as
[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) (with PoW-based consensus) to permissioned
platforms such as [Tendermint](http://tendermint.com/),
[Chain](http://chain.com/), and [Quorum](http://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum).

Smart contracts executing in a blockchain that operates with the order-execute
architecture must be deterministic; otherwise, consensus might never be reached.
To address the non-determinism issue, many platforms require that the smart
contracts be written in a non-standard, or domain-specific language
(such as [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.23/)) so that
non-deterministic operations can be eliminated. This hinders wide-spread
adoption because it requires developers writing smart contracts to learn a new
language and may lead to programming errors.

Further, since all transactions are executed sequentially by all nodes,
performance and scale is limited. The fact that the smart contract code executes
on every node in the system demands that complex measures be taken to protect
the overall system from potentially malicious contracts in order to ensure
resiliency of the overall system.

## A New Approach

Fabric introduces a new architecture for transactions that we call
**execute-order-validate**. It addresses the resiliency, flexibility,
scalability, performance and confidentiality challenges faced by the
order-execute model by separating the transaction flow into three steps:

- _execute_ a transaction and check its correctness, thereby endorsing it,
- _order_ transactions via a (pluggable) consensus protocol, and
- _validate_ transactions against an application-specific endorsement policy
before committing them to the ledger

This design departs radically from the order-execute paradigm in that Fabric
executes transactions before reaching final agreement on their order.

In Fabric, an application-specific endorsement policy specifies which peer
nodes, or how many of them, need to vouch for the correct execution of a given
smart contract. Thus, each transaction need only be executed (endorsed) by the
subset of the peer nodes necessary to satisfy the transaction's endorsement
policy. This allows for parallel execution increasing overall performance and
scale of the system. This first phase also **eliminates any non-determinism**,
as inconsistent results can be filtered out before ordering.

Because we have eliminated non-determinism, Fabric is the first blockchain
technology that **enables use of standard programming languages**.

## Privacy and Confidentiality

As we have discussed, in a public, permissionless blockchain network that
leverages PoW for its consensus model, transactions are executed on every node.
This means that neither can there be confidentiality of the contracts
themselves, nor of the transaction data that they process. Every transaction,
and the code that implements it, is visible to every node in the network. In
this case, we have traded confidentiality of contract and data for byzantine
fault tolerant consensus delivered by PoW.

This lack of confidentiality can be problematic for many business/enterprise use
cases. For example, in a network of supply-chain partners, some consumers might
be given preferred rates as a means of either solidifying a relationship, or
promoting additional sales. If every participant can see every contract and
transaction, it becomes impossible to maintain such business relationships in a
completely transparent network --- everyone will want the preferred rates!

As a second example, consider the securities industry, where a trader building
a position (or disposing of one) would not want her competitors to know of this,
or else they will seek to get in on the game, weakening the trader's gambit.

In order to address the lack of privacy and confidentiality for purposes of
delivering on enterprise use case requirements, blockchain platforms have
adopted a variety of approaches. All have their trade-offs.

Encrypting data is one approach to providing confidentiality; however, in a
permissionless network leveraging PoW for its consensus, the encrypted data is
sitting on every node. Given enough time and computational resource, the
encryption could be broken. For many enterprise use cases, the risk that their
information could become compromised is unacceptable.

Zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) are another area of research being explored to
address this problem, the trade-off here being that, presently, computing a ZKP
requires considerable time and computational resources. Hence, the trade-off in
this case is performance for confidentiality.

In a permissioned context that can leverage alternate forms of consensus, one
might explore approaches that restrict the distribution of confidential
information exclusively to authorized nodes.

Hyperledger Fabric, being a permissioned platform, enables confidentiality
through its channel architecture and [private data](./private-data/private-data.html)
feature. In channels, participants on a Fabric network establish a sub-network
where every member has visibility to a particular set of transactions. Thus, only
those nodes that participate in a channel have access to the smart contract
(chaincode) and data transacted, preserving the privacy and confidentiality of
both. Private data allows collections between members on a channel, allowing
much of the same protection as channels without the maintenance overhead of
creating and maintaining a separate channel.

## Pluggable Consensus

The ordering of transactions is delegated to a modular component for consensus
that is logically decoupled from the peers that execute transactions and
maintain the ledger. Specifically, the ordering service. Since consensus is
modular, its implementation can be tailored to the trust assumption of a
particular deployment or solution. This modular architecture allows the platform
to rely on well-established toolkits for CFT (crash fault-tolerant) or BFT
(byzantine fault-tolerant) ordering.

Fabric currently offers a CFT ordering service implementation
based on the [`etcd` library](https://coreos.com/etcd/) of the [Raft protocol](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf).
For information about currently available ordering services, check
out our [conceptual documentation about ordering](./orderer/ordering_service.html).

Note also that these are not mutually exclusive. A Fabric network can have
multiple ordering services supporting different applications or application
requirements.

## Performance and Scalability

Performance of a blockchain platform can be affected by many variables such as
transaction size, block size, network size, as well as limits of the hardware,
etc. The Hyperledger Fabric [Performance and Scale working group](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/PSWG/Performance+and+Scale+Working+Group)
currently works on a benchmarking framework called [Hyperledger Caliper](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/caliper).

Several research papers have been published studying and testing the performance
capabilities of Hyperledger Fabric. The latest [scaled Fabric to 20,000 transactions per second](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00910).

## Conclusion

Any serious evaluation of blockchain platforms should include Hyperledger Fabric
in its short list.

Combined, the differentiating capabilities of Fabric make it a highly scalable
system for permissioned blockchains supporting flexible trust assumptions that
enable the platform to support a wide range of industry use cases ranging from
government, to finance, to supply-chain logistics, to healthcare and so much
more.

Hyperledger Fabric is the most active of the Hyperledger projects. The community
building around the platform is growing steadily, and the innovation delivered
with each successive release far out-paces any of the other enterprise blockchain
platforms.
